The Odin Project's CSS assignment on landing page

For this assignment, I took the approach of replicating the prompt as much
as possible. In my journey to do this I discovered lots of new flexbox behaviours
aswell as rediscovered certain other behaviors I thought I knew such as flex-wrap, flow,
margin and overriding styles of already existing elements.

My main challenge for this prompt was not overlooking certain details while also not
overfocusing in said details. Sometimes you have to look at them and try to tweak them
but I quickly began to over-tweak things when my first approach did not work.

My main takeaway from this project is that I need to improve my workflow by multi-layering
the work I do. What I mean with this is that, based on my own workflow and my personal
abilities, I should've tried to lay the website first and then nitpick the details. My
approach was close to this but I spent too much time looking at details that I probably won't
do when I'm working on a real project.

All things considered, I was very conscious of my own choices and my workflow detours
based on the fact that I'm here to learn, study and experiment so I'm not trying to
rush things here. My main takeaway is that I really need to define what my approach will be
before writing any lines of code.
